# NLP_topic_embeddings
Classifying financial complaints into >400 categories, using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and deep-learning. Specifically, I explore the using of "topic embedding" (inspired by the InstaCart models) to reduce the effective dimensionality of the financial "sub-issues" into a low-dimension space. This was a demo-project for Insight Data Toronto
